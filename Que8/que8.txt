1. Predicted Output:

Hello
TypeError: sayHi is not a function


Explanation:

sayHello() is a function declaration, which is fully hoisted along with its definition.
Therefore, calling it before its declaration works and prints "Hello".

sayHi is declared using var and assigned a function expression.
During hoisting, only the variable sayHi is hoisted and initialized as undefined.

When sayHi() is called, it tries to execute undefined as a function, which causes a TypeError.
